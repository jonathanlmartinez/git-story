I went on a trip to California last week.
My girlfriend and I had the chance to go surfing. 
Let me tell you, it was a lot harder than I though, and Bekah will tell you so was the surf board.
A wave wiped her out and hit her right in the forget, ouch!
It was very funny but painful at the same time. 
Overall we had a great time.
